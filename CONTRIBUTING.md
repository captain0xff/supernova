# Contributing Guide
All contributions are welcome but please keep these things in mind before contributing.

## Code style
* All functions should be named in snake_case.
* All classes and structs should named in PascalCase.
* Enums should be named in all caps.
* Similar types should be together like globals, structs and classes, separated by 3 empty lines.
* Tab/4 spaces should be used for indentation.
* Separate different preprocessor directives by two empty lines.
* Similar includes should be kept together.
* Standard library headers should be a the top, followed by global headers and finally locals one.
* There should one line gap between these.
* `Using namespace` statements should come next separated by a gap of two lines from the includes.
* Below this the main code should be there after a gap of 3 lines.
* For documentation use comments like this:-
	```
	/**

	 */
	```
